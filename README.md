# Unreal Engine 5 C++ Intermediate Tutorial Series

This game with the working title *Fab* is a learning resource and associated with the YouTube Playlist: [...].

## Getting started

At the state of this commit, the project is based on **Unreal Engine 5.3.2**. I recommend using this or a newer version, but you can of course try running it with what you already have installed. In order to run the project:

1. Clone the repository
2. Open Fab.uproject with Rider, or right-click "Generate Visual Studio project files" -> open with Visual Studio
3. Build from source
4. Open Fab.uproject and start developing

```
git clone https://github.com/kaijurgeit/Fab.git
```

## The Game

Fab is a co-op third-person RPG which aims at teaching gameplay programming and being fun to play. It employs the Game Ability System and shows how to implement a flexible inventory, combat and skill system as well as non-player character ai based on StateTrees and more to come.
